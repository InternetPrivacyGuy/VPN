# List of VPNs
I've assembled this massive list of VPNs to help people find a VPN that fits their needs. From a privacy standpoint, not all of these VPNs are perfect, so I recommend looking through any of these you're interested in before signing up for the service.

## Avira Phantom VPN
Avira Phantom VPN masks your real IP address to make you look like you’re somewhere (and someone) else.

## AzireVPN
AzireVPN doesn’t keep any logs. This means that they have no data to provide, even if they are saddled with a court order. In addition, all of the ports are open and there is no censorship since there are no ISP restrictions. You can visit the sites and services you want without worry, and while being anonymous. They offer the best encryption available with TLS auth and AES-256, as well as full IPv6 support.
